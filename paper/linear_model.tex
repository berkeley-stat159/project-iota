\section{Linear modeling} 

The basic idea of linear models is to find the relationship between a response 
variable and one or more explanatory variables (regressors). For our purposes, 
we attempt to define a relationship between the BOLD signals and the working 
memory tasks. Mathematically, our model is as follows: 

$$y = X \beta + \epsilon, X = \{1, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k\}.$$

To perform hypothesis tests using this model, we assume linearity of the 
relationship, and $E [\epsilon | X ] = 0, Var [ \epsilon | X ] = \Omega$. We 
solve for linear regression using generalized least square: 

$$\hat{\beta} = (X^T \Omega^{-1}X)^{-1} X^T \Omega^{-1} Y.$$ 

After finding estimates for the $\beta$s, we perform Student t-test for each 
$\beta_i$, where $H_0: \beta_i = 0, i = \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$.
